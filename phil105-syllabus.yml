title: The Philosophy of Food 

quote: 
- content: 'First we eat, then we do everything else'
  title: The Art of Eating
  author: 'M.F.K. Fischer'

# Sections
overview: |
  Food is a central part of human life, both in its production and
  consumption. Food is closely tied to the values that we hold, and the
  cultural identities that we endorse (e.g. the sorts of things that we eat
  vs. the sorts of things that they eat). Our choices about food, both as
  individuals and as a society raise a variety of moral, political, and
  economic questions. Some of the questions we shall pursue include:

    - What *is* food? Not everything we eat we can digest. Moreover, some of the
      things we could eat and digest (such as other people), we don’t. Why
      not? Are some aspects of what we consider "food" dependent on our social practices?

    - What are the major economic and political structures governing food
      production and comsumption in the United States and other western
      countries? How do these structures impact developing countries?
      
    - What are the environmental and social consequences of various sorts of
      eating habits? For example, do food choices contribute to environmental
      degradation and social injustice?

    - How should we treat the animals we eat? Do we have ethical obligations
      to treat them in particular ways?

    - In what ways does food connect to religious and cultural identities? To
      what extent can a society legislate for or against food practices that
      impinge on such identities?
objectives: |
  - This course satisfies ACE requirement 5, that students use knowledge, historical perspectives, analysis, interpretation, critical evaluation, and the standards of evidence appropriate to the humanities to address problems and issues. Students will be evaluated with respect to these outcomes by taking regular quizzes, and more comprehensivly, by two exams and a final paper.

  - PHIL 105 also satisfies ACE requirement 8, that students use knowledge, theories, and analysis to explain ethical principles and their importance in society. Students will be evaluated with respect to these outcomes by answering essay questions in the two exams and by writing a paper.

  - In completing this course students satisfy these outcomes by being able to (i) find the argument of a text and restate it clearly in their own words; (ii) explain viewpoints clearly that are not their own; (iii) think critically about the ideas discussed in this course, including the moral and political significance of our food choices; (iv) explain the practical significance of different courses of action regarding our food choices, both as individuals and as a society; (v) write papers using theses, organization, arguments, evidence, and language suitable to analytical writing in general and the discipline of philosophy in particular.

requirements:
- preparation: 'You are expected to attend every class meeting fully prepared to discuss each assigned reading, to submit written work punctually, and to offer thoughtful and constructive responses to the remarks of your instructor and your classmates. Make sure that you bring the relevant readings with you to every lecture class. I further expect you to treat both the texts at hand and your classmates’ ideas with openness and respect. Because the topics in this course may be emotionally charged or challenging for class members, I hope we can create an environment that is both intellectually productive and supportive for all. Beyond verbal participation, your active and supportive listening is also an important and valuable form of participation. I hope that we will continuously reflect upon our class processes so that we can build an inclusive intellectual community where all feel valued and supported in their learning.'
  attendance: 'Attendance is required. You are also expected to attend every section meeting. Up to 1/2 a letter grade could be deducted from your final course grade for every absence from section after your fifth.'
  website: 'We will use a course website for all materials. The site address is: [https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/49195](https://canvas.unl.edu/courses/49195). Upcoming assignments and readings will be posted there. Please let me know if you have any problems. Technical glitches, computer malfunctions and crashing hard drives are not excuses for failing to complete work in this class.'
  papers: 'Please submit work as a .docx, .odt, or .rtf file. All work must be typed. I will not accept any handwritten work aside from that we do in class. Your papers should be in 12-point Times New Roman font, double-spaced with margins set to one inch on all sides. Your name, my name, the date and assignment should appear in the top left hand corner of the first page. Your last name and page number must appear in the top right hand corner on each subsequent page. Please staple or paperclip hard copies of papers and drafts. You are responsible for the presentation of your papers.'
  grading: |
    UNL uses an A through F system where a student's grade point average (GPA) is computed based on point values assigned to each grade. Passing grades are A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, and P. Students registered Pass/No Pass must earn a grade of "C" or better for a "P" grade. A grade of "F" represents that the student did not pass the course. The "F" is factored into the Grade Point Average. 
    A grade of "I" or incomplete signifies that the student was unable to complete the course. Incomplete grades are used only when illness, military service, hardship, or death in the immediate family prevents a student from completing a course in which *requirements have already been substantially completed*. The student **should** complete assignments and/or exams WITHOUT re-registering or attending the course in a subsequent term. All "I" grades issued for *undergraduate* courses automatically expire and are replaced with a failing grade one year after the end of the current term, unless a grade change form is received from the instructor prior to that time.

  late-work: 'Late papers and assignments will standardly be marked down by **1/3 of a letter grade for each day the work is late** (for example, from A- to B+, from B+ to B, and so on).'

If you need to have your phone available due to an emergency, you will alert me to this before class begins.'
resources:
- jargon: 'It’s important to be on top of the technical terms used by philosophers. Please ask for clarification of terms in class. You can also consult Jim Pryor’s online "[Philosophical Terms and Methods.](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/vocab/)" at [http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/vocab/](http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/vocab/).'
  help: |
    Papers should adhere to some consistent practice of footnoting and citation (Chicago, MLA, etc.). I don’t really mind which one you use as long as you are consistent. On writing a philosophy paper, there is no better on-line guide than Jim Pryor’s. Please consult it. Hacker’s A Writer’s Reference is also extremely helpful. Useful online writing help may be found at the Purdue Online Writing Lab at [http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/).
